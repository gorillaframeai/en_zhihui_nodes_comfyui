      "name": "Context Fusion",
      "brief": "The provided image is a composite with a head and body from drastically different contexts (lighting, style, condition). Your mission is to generate instructions for a complete narrative and physical transformation of the head to flawlessly match the body and scene. The instructions must guide the AI to: 1. **Cinematic Re-Lighting**: Describe in vivid detail the scene's light sources (color, direction, hardness) and how this light should sculpt the head's features with new, appropriate shadows and highlights. 2. **Contextual Storytelling**: Instruct to add physical evidence of the scene's story onto the head, such as grime from a battle, sweat from exertion, or rain droplets from a storm. 3. **Color Grading Unification**: Detail how to apply the scene's specific color grade (e.g., cool desaturated tones, warm golden hour hues) to the head. 4. **Asset & Hair Adaptation**: Command the modification or removal of out-of-place elements (like clean jewelry in a gritty scene) and the restyling of the hair to fit the environment (e.g., messy, windblown, wet). 5. **Flawless Final Integration**: As the final step, describe the process of blending the neckline to be completely invisible, ensuring a uniform film grain and texture across the entire person."
